The main feature here is to identify some know patterns, make a few (or a lot) process into the query and then return the String that represents the final query.\r\n\r\nA great scenario is when you need to receive some input from a program/user/whatever and then you need to make some changes into this input to pass to another program/user/whatever.\r\n\r\nSo, i hope that this project may help you.\r\n\r\nSome helpfull links:\r\n\r\n[Full source of this project](https://github.com/softctrl/sc-regex-criterya-lib/archive/master.zip).\r\n\r\n[The library jar](https://github.com/softctrl/sc-regex-criterya-lib/blob/master/files/sc-regex-criterya-lib-0.0.3-SNAPSHOT.jar?raw=true).\r\n\r\n[My personal blog-0x09](http://www.0x09.com.br/).\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/softctrl/sc-regex-criterya-lib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/softctrl/sc-regex-criterya-lib)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCarlos Timoshenko (@defunkt).",
