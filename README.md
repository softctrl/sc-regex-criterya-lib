### sc-req-resp-lib - Just a little project to parse queries


So, just this little project aims to help you to process any kind of query. The main feature here is to identify some know patterns, make a few (or a lot) process into the query and then return the String that represents the final query.

A great scenario is when you need to receive some input from a program/user/whatever and then you need to make some changes into this input to pass to another program/user/whatever.

So, i hope that this project may help you.
